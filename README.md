# BIRADS classification and feature identification in breast imaging
This repository contains the code I wrote for the 6th digix global ai challenge:[BI_RADS](https://www.saikr.com/vse/2024/DIGIX).
Final Ranking: 23rd out of 240.
Now I am open-sourcing the code, hoping to provide relevant assistance to those working in this field.  

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure that you have a suitable Python environment with necessary dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies via:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt                                ```
